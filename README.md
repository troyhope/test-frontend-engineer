# Frontend Developer Take-Home Test

## Overview

Develop a responsive e-commerce web application that allows users to browse products, view product details, and add products to a shopping cart.
The application should integrate with a backend API to fetch product data.

- The goal is a clear demonstration of quality, functionality, and thought process.
- **Timebox:** The test is designed to be completed in 6 hours or less.
- **Commit Often:** Show your working process through regular commits.
- **External dependencies:** Use any external dependencies you see fit, you do not need to implement everything from scratch.
- **Keep It Minimal:** Use lightweight libraries and avoid adding unnecessary features, or over-engineering the solution.

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **Product Listing Page**

   - Display a list of products with images, names, and prices.
   - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling.

2. **Product Detail Page**

   - Show detailed information about the selected product.
   - Include an "Add to Cart" button.

3. **Shopping Cart**

   - Allow users to view products added to their cart.
   - Display the total price and quantity of items.
   - Enable users to remove items from the cart.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the application is usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Technical

- **Frameworks & Libraries**

  - **Next.js** with **TypeScript**.
  - Style components using **Tailwind CSS**.

- **State Management**

  - Manage application state efficiently.

- **TypeScript**
  - Use TypeScript for type-checking and code quality.
  -
- **API Integration**

  - Fetch data from a provided RESTful API endpoint.
  - Handle loading states and error handling gracefully.
  - API should be typed using TypeScript.

- **Code Quality**

  - Apply **SOLID principles** and design patterns.
  - Write consistent, clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
  - Create universal and reusable UI components.

- **Testing**
  - Write unit tests for critical components (optional).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this Repository**

   - You can start by forking this repository.

2. **Setup Project**

   - Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
   - Install Tailwind CSS and configure it.

3. **API Endpoint**

   - Use a mock API for product data such as [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/).

4. **Development**
   - Follow the requirements to build the application.
   - Ensure the application builds and runs without errors.

## Submission Guidelines

- **Repository**

  - Push your code to a **public GitHub repository**.
  - Ensure the repository has a clear commit history, and commit regularly.
  - Ensure the repository is a fork of this repository.

- **README File**

  - Include instructions on how to run your application.
  - Describe your thought process and any architectural decisions.
  - Mention any trade-offs or assumptions made during development.

- **Deployment**

  - (Optional) Deploy your application using services like **Vercel**.
  - Provide a link to the live application if deployed.

- **Submission**
  - Email us the link to your GitHub repository (and live demo if available) at [sam.thompson@playa3ull.games].

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**

  - Does the application meet all the functional requirements?

- **Code Quality**

  - Is the code clean, well-organized, and maintainable?
  - Are SOLID principles and design patterns appropriately applied?

- **Technical Skills**

  - Effective use of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
  - Proper integration with the backend API.

- **User Experience**

  - Is the UI responsive and user-friendly?
  - Does the design consider good UX practices?

- **Problem-Solving**

  - How were challenges addressed?
  - Were creative solutions implemented?

- **Documentation**
  - Clarity of the README file.
  - Use of comments and documentation within the code.

## Extra Credit

_These are not required but can showcase your additional skills:_

- **GraphQL or tRPC**

  - Use GraphQL or tRPC instead of REST for API interactions.

- **Monorepo Setup**

  - Organize your project using a monorepo approach.

- **SEO Enhancements**

  - Implement SEO optimisation.

- **E-commerce Features**
  - Add user authentication.
  - Implement a checkout process.

## Implementation Details

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- Typescript for type safety
- React Context for client-side data management
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### Architecture Choices

- Used feature-based approach for simplicity and time constraints
- Could be expanded to Feature-Sliced Design or Atomic Design for larger applications
- Current structure maintains good separation of concerns while staying pragmatic
